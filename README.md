# Ponzo-illusion
The Ponzo illusion was first demonstrated in 1913 by an Italian
psychologist named Mario Ponzo. The two yellow lines are the exact
same length. Because they are placed over parallel lines that seem to
converge in the distance, the top yellow line actually appears to be
longer than the bottom one.
